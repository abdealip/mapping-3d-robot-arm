Joint states published at 50 Hz

Voxel Size, Update Time
0.01, 0.854
0.02, 0.115
0.025, 0.063

Things to include for report:
- goals
- algorithm overview
- proof of concept - map from zero joint angles
- relationship between voxel size and map update time
- relationship between sample period, map quality, and runtime
- (stretch goal) - video of map being updated in realtime
- next steps (camera)

TODO for code:
- figure out how to make a video of the map being updated (multithreading probably)
- shell script to do profiling for report stuff
