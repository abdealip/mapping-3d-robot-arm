TODO:

- take video of camera mapping process

{
- get dimensions of CNC machines and tubelights and populate environment.json
- make environment_rasterizer consume groups of polygons rather than single polygons
  - write the point cloud for each group of polygons to a file in a directory
} OR
{
  - create a program to turn an STL file into a point cloud
}

- implement ICP or robust ICP or some point cloud registration method to register the
  expected environment with the actual environment - this should consume a list of 
  {STL_file, transform} and output a list of {STL_file, transform_corrected}

- write a program to consume a list of {STL_file, transform_corrected} and output the result
  to a single STL file

- edit scene_manager to consume the resultant stl (as an argument)

- test to see if it displays properly in rviz
