TODO:

- edit and upload video of camera mapping process

- implement ICP or robust ICP or some point cloud registration method to register the
  expected environment with the actual environment - this should consume a list of 
  {STL_file, transform} and output a list of {STL_file, transform_corrected}

- write a program to consume a list of {STL_file, transform_corrected} and output the result
  to a single STL file

- edit scene_manager to consume the resultant stl (as an argument)

- test to see if it displays properly in rviz

- write paper and documentation
